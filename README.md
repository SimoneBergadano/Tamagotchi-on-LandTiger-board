# Tamagotchi Project

In this master's project I programmed an ARM microprocessor board called LandTiger. The goal of the course project is to program a tamagotchi that the user can interact with. In the project I used the Keil ÂµVision IDE, the project required the control of numerous peripherals such as LEDs, joypad, buttons, touch display and speaker to play sounds.
